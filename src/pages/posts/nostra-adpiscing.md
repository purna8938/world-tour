My ventures strategic approach is niche. Our venture is mostly dealt with the relationship with the customers. We have only a few products that are based on travel. We have only a few sets of markets like young age and old age people 

We have 24*7 support to our customers. Giving incentives to our employees who are hardworking and do a great job in the companies success. Also having a good relationship with customers every year trips to employees. Allies or financiers make necessary investments and giving proper interviews to media so it will make good publicity to our company

Technology risk:

  • My competitors are launching mobile applications for different platforms like iOS, Android, the website for all competitors. As a new venture, we haven't created mobile apps and websites, so we are lack of reach to customers.  

• Some of the ventures introduced artificial intelligence to their projects to easily plan their trips depend upon their schedule. 

 • In recent times everyone is building applications based on Facebook, Google, and Amazon. They have a lot of customers that we can spread our idea easily but we have a security breach in some of the big tech companies.

 Solution:  

• We ensure that every customer data will be confidential and payment information will be safe. We don’t have security problems and aligned with apple to reach the customers and maintain security. So we can attract more customers within less time

. • We are working on different platforms like mobile applications and artificial intelligence soon we will launch on a website and mobile applications 

Competitive risk:

 • My venture has huge competitive risks like hotels, travel agency and companies like Airbnb, MakeMyTrip and Oyo are already have set their mark. Competition is a huge risk to my travel agency venture because everyone is offering some kind of offers like Airbnb. Solution:  

• We cannot reduce the competitors. Depending upon the alliance we make with insurance and governments we can offer our customers to lower and comfortable deals. Competitors can help to make the best product 

Financial risk:

 • There are a lot of financial risks including in my venture.in my venture we are buying and built new houses in tourist places for that in any fall in real estate can have a huge financial risk after buying the rents. 

 • As a host, we book houses and flights all packages. If they cancel their trips and asks for a refund as per cancellation policy after the end of the trip has a huge financial risk to our venture. We have to pay the guests and flight ticket bookings and a lot of loss for a travel agency.  

Solution:  

• We make the most of the customers satisfy and help the city grow and help them to make employ or city grow in tourist areas. So that will make increase the real estate and increase our property rate.  • We can put a good cancellation policy to our customers to make sure that we cannot refund after the last date of our cancellation policy.
